scored on:
mean return - 0.1 \* StdDev(mean return)

    StdDev(mean return) =
    1. calculate return for each day,
    2. calculate mean return
    3. calculate deviation from the mean for each data point,
    4. square the deviations
    5. calculate the variance which is sum of squared deviations / N
    6. square root variance

    StdDev(mean return) is a measure of volitility in our strategy, as high differences in daily return are squared, they have a significantly higher impact on StdDev


ideas from Nic
 - Trading using a mean price over x time period (for example 1 week or 1 month average) ie dollar cost averaging
